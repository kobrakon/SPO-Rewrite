Allows you to edit the health values for players, AI and bosses individually.
This can be done in a couple of ways.  bodyPartMode (if enabled) will directly set the health values of each bodypart to its corresponding config option.
If disabled then the health value will be multiplied by the healthMultiplier instead (where 1 is default, 2 is double, 0.5 is half etc)
If AllEqualToPlayer is set to true, then all bots will have their health values set to the same as the player (following whatever bodypart or multiplier settings applied to the player.)
The values in the config are from the default player health values.  Everything is disabled by default.

***Notice***
Due to the profile not being created yet, you will need to restart the game following fresh profile creation for player health changes to take effect.
