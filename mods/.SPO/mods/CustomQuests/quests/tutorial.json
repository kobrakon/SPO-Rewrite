First thing you should know is this: Money is practically worthless now. Sure some people will still do business with it. But bartering is king out here. There's a few traders still in the zone, you'll find them as you go. I need some things from a couple of them. First, I need a new sight for my trusty boy here; Last time I checked at Prapors he had Obzor, sure he will barter for it. Find him Tushonka, he is a sucker for it. As it turns out, those little items can get you a lot if its the right person at the right time. Prapor is located between the woods and the Factory; the doctor, Therapist is also there should you need medical items. You can get to them either through the Factory entrance on the South-East end of the woods, or by going through Gate 3 in the Factory; though you'll need a key for that.",
