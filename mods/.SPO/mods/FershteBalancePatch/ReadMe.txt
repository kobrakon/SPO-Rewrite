Hoi; I'm Fershte; and I made a gigantic balance patch.
EFT's balance is extremely ill fitting for a single player experience.
So, I opted to change basically everything.

//Changelog Feb 12 2022
SCAR fixes, hilarious SAKER fix, foregrip changes.

//Changelog Feb 5 2022
Way too much to say, lol. It balances out a whole lot of the new parts from 12.11 and 12.12, etc. Some good wood in here :)

//Changelog April 25 2021
Tweaks now also restores the AS Vall / VSS to a more realistic level of recoil.
Tweaks now also rebalances the Sig MCX to a more realistic level of recoil - it performs quite like an M4.

//Changelog April 10 2021
"tweaks" to both MDRs, the RFB, AKS-74U, and VPO-209 to make them a little more competitive.
adjusted muzzle devices
client stability improved 

To choose what this mod balances, simply go into the config and change any true to a false:
	"optics":true,
	"pistolGrips":true,
	"furniture":true,
	"stocks":true,
	"foregrips":true,
	"muzzledevices":true,
	"tweaks":false

Optics makes every optic equal in ergo penalty to the bis in that category, so you can choose based on your preferences rather than meta.

PistolGrips breaks grips into 3 categories and dramatically expands how many items are bis or great.

Furniture tweaks weapon handguards mostly, and aims to make gun customization a little more fun and aesthetic while retaining some min maxing.

Stocks tries to make AR-15 compatible stocks a little more sane.

Foregrips makes all foregrips almost equally valuable, but in 4 categories based on mission, from high ergo to high recoil.

MuzzleDevices is my personal bugbear, balancing tarkov's muzzle devices gives me a headache. I hope you like my changes!

Tweaks doesn't do anything in this version, but in future versions it will make balance changes that don't fit these categories.
