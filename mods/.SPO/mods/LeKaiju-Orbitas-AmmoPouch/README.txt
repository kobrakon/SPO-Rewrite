General outline:
    The Lucky Scav Ammo Pouch:
        Adds a new item to the game for storing loose ammunition. Can be put into your secure container. May have traces of blood on it but still works!

Important notes:
    In the config you'll find settings to enable or disable the mod, and adjust its capacity if you wish by changing the grid Horizontal and Vertical values.
    Once installed you'll be able to buy them from Skier at loyalty level 1.

How to install:
    To install, simply drop the folder into user/mods.
    To uninstall, make sure ALL pouches added by this mod are sold/removed from your stash before deleting the mod folder.
