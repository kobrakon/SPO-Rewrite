!!!Warning!!!  The auto sort stash feature can cause issues, I would highly advise against using it. !!!Warning!!! 

Set your desired stash sizes in config.json.

If ChangeAll = false, it will change the stash sizes for each account type individually, It is important to have these in ascending order, as you need to upgrade the stash in your hideout to unlock other upgrades.

If ChangeAll = any whole number, it will set all of the accounts stash size to that value.
