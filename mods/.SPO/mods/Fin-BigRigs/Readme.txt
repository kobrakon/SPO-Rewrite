		Fin's Realistically Equipped Traders


What is this mod?

	This mod attempts to make traders an interesting part of the SPT world, instead of just a way to get infinite copies of your favourite loadout over and over and over. Traders will sell you only a limited amount of gear, and the weapons they have to offer won't be in pristine condition.
	
	I HIGHLY recommend this mod be used in conjunction with mods or game settings that give the AI damaged weapons, as well.
	
So what exactly does it do?

	This mod takes a random selection of items that the trader could normally sell you (IE. If you're LL2 with Prapor, it will only pick from items he sells at or below LL2) and gives them to the trader in limited quantities. You might get, for instance, two AKMs, one PP19, and one mosin as the weapons available for purchase from that trader for that reset. These are the ONLY weapons that will be sold by them for the next three hours, and once you've purchased all four, no more will be available for purchase from that trader. Most other items will be similarly limited: If you see a stack of 59 LPS GzH rounds for sale, those 59 are all there are from that trader.
	
	Weapons will also be sold damaged. The exact level of damage depends on your loyalty level with the trader, but at LL1 they'll be between 55% and 91.8% durability, improving to between 70% and 97.2% durability at LL4.
	
	Armor is sold at full durability.
	
	The flea market is, obviously, disabled by this mod.
	
	Traders don't reset when you restart the server. They require three IRL hours to pass, before they'll restock.
	

How do I use this mod?

	Drag the "Fin - Realistically Equipped Traders" folder into your user/mods directory
	

What if I want to change the settings?

	allow_barter_trades determines whether or not the traders will include barter trades in their inventory. Note: This generally makes things even harder, and is disabled by default.
	
	price_multipliers allows you to change the price of various items the traders sell. These multiplies can only INCREASE trader prices, they can't decrease them.
	

There isn't enough gear / I don't want damaged gear!

	Kill more scavs. Loot more weapon crates. Hunt down some bosses. Find pristine loose-loot weapons. The point of this mod is to keep the game from reaching the point where you always have everything you want. Is the SVD Prapor will sell you only at 70% durability? -Well, now you have a reason to care when you find a raider or a PMC with an SVD, because it might actually be an upgrade for once. Are none of the traders selling your favourite guns? Awesome! Play with something new. There's only 82 rounds of good AP ammo on sale, and only two compatible magazines? -It sounds like you're going to have to be pretty careful on your next run, then.
	
	
There are still some items that are available in infinite amounts, though?

	There may be a couple of items that have slipped through my net, and I'll release updates to catch them as well, if I notice them. I've also made sure that quest items aren't limited, so you'll always to be able to buy as many multitools and wireless cameras as you need.
	
	
Are there any known bugs?

	The only one I'm aware of at the moment is that ammo boxes will appear to be empty when in the trader's inventory. When you buy them, however, they will be full. This is just a visual bug.
