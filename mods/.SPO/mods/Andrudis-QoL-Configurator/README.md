###Collaboration configuration - collaboration_config.json
[WARNING]: Temporary DISABLED as KMC mods are not yet updated for 2.2.0 and even when they will be updated - wait for QoL Configurator update!

See '\scr\collaboration_config.json' where you can enable/disable collaboration with other supported mods:
* KMC_Gear - when enabled, adds gears from mod to loot containers loot pool according to configuration in '\src\collaboration\KMC_Gear\kmc_gear.json'. 
* KMC_Weapons - when enabled, adds mods and ammo from mod to loot containers loot pool according to configuration in '\src\collaboration\KMC_Weapons\kmc_mods_and_ammo.json'. 
Note: Collaboration options should be disabled if target mod is not installed or removed!

### Adjust Items Spawn Configuration
Only works in "AdjustItemsSpawnInContainers" is set to 'true' in main config file. 
There are multiple items (barrels, foregrips, ammo, ironsights etc.) which are not added to loot containers spawn tables and so never spawn inside any containers.
In folder \src\loot_spawn_configs\ - there are a number of files with configurations to add missing item spawns to loot containers.
You are free to remove, edit or add your own spawn configurations as you like - just put them in 'loot_spawn_configs' folder.
Should be compatible with other mods that add new items to the game as long as they are loaded before this mod - you can create your own config files for those items and add them to loot pool of containers you want

Each file starts with 'AdjustAlreadyExistingItems' param
* AdjustAlreadyExistingItems - if set to 'true' will override spawn chances for existing items, default is 'false' which will only add items that do not yet exists in containers' loot tables and ignore already existing ones. This setting has affect only for one specific configuration file - each file is handled separately.
* ItemsSpawnConfigs - contains list of items to be added/edited for containers' loot tables

Each record consists of the following fields:
* Name - for your reference and log only, does not have any effect
* UID - EFT '_id' value for item you want to edit. Use 'items.json' or 'https://items.sp-tarkov.com/' for reference. If item with this UID does not exist - whole record will just be ignored
* EnableSpawnChanceAdjustment - change to any value except 'true' to disable this record without deleting it.
* RelativeSpawnChance - set relative spawn chance. EFT values usually go between 1 and 5000, but can be set higher. Higher value gives more chances to spawn this item.
* SpawnInAnyContainer - if set to 'true' item will be added to loot table of each available container in the game
* MimicItemSpawn - enter another item's '_id' to spawn your item in the same containers where mimicked item can be spawned. NOTE: this setting is ignored if your item already has at least 1 spawn container defined, i.e. only works for items that has no spawns defined yet at all.
* IntendedContainers - coma-separated list if container IDs in which you want to spawn this item.  See 'container IDs.txt' for full list
Note: if item can already spawn in a given container, second spawn will not be added - instead existing spawn chance will be altered
