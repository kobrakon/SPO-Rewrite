*ClairrePurr was the original creator of this mod, at the time of me writing this (Hosav), it seems they deleted the mod (which was only working with A7).
I am uploading this mod, updated to the latest version of SPT-AKI. Special thanks to VeryGery for the help he gave me figuring out the updated calls*

The goal of this mod is to make single player mode has its own special enjoyable content.

*This is a WIP mod.*
(But it is already functional, just lacking more patterns, and of course bugs...)

This mod will remove all original spawn in SPT server, then add new spawns to it. This way actually solved my FPS drop in mid game. This does not make any sense to me, but it works...

Core function of this mod is a basic frame to load pattern files and its config files.
Pattern files and its config files can make bot spawn according to certain rules. For example, a pattern called CP-Default is included in the mod:

1. Basic values such as total waves, min max of the waves, difficulty, spawn locations...etc. can be set to each map and each bot type.
2. Spawn location can have chances.
3. PMC can be spawned as cursedAssault, a very aggressive bot. You can set enable/disable this for each map.
4. All boss values can be modified. It is possible to spawn boss to other map. (Imagine Killa in dorm...)
