This mod has a very simple goal of not just reducing production time to zero, but allowing you to incrementally change it to your personal taste.
Maybe instead of an item taking 4 hours to craft, it takes 40. Bear in mind, this is an incremental change to all recipes. This does not allow you to change individual recipes.

To enable this, simply set "EnableFastProd" to true in config.json, then change "percent" to any whole integer value between 1-100. Do NOT use 0. This will have some unintended
affects and will break the game.

This is my first mod, so please leave any feedback you have on the comments section.
