# Path to Tarkov
Connect all available maps through the extracts points, bring a multi-stash system and lock traders according to the player offraid position.

## Description
This mod bring the notion of "offraid position" for the player, it locks certains maps according to this offraid position, change all player spawn points to reflect this positions, change the hideout stash and lock/unlock traders according to the config file.

For example, if the position is "FactoryZB-1011", only Customs and Factory maps should be available for infiltration.

All corresponding offraid positions, extracts and spawn points can be configured via `config.json` file.

New spawn points can be added in `player_spawnpoints.json`

## Features
- Maps are locked/unlocked according to the offraid position
- Several hideout stash according to your offraid position (and the configuration file)
- Hideout features disabled when player is not on the main stash position
- Traders are available only on certains offraid position
- Tweak exfiltrations points (fixed for each map + removed restrictions)
- Changed spawn points according to the offraid position
- Certains offraid locations enable/disable the hydration/energy/health restoration (according to config)

## How to edit the current offraid position
The offraid position is stored in your profile in a dedicated field `PathToTarkov`, you can edit it with a regular text editor.


## Known issues
- Sadly, Scav exfils cannot be used by a pmc (I don't know if it's a BSG limitation or if SPT-AKI doesn't implement a way to tweak this values)
- Some hideout features cannot be disabled without crashing the game (generator, water collector and air filtering unit)

## UnInstallation
Before deleting the mod, you can set the `enabled` props to `false` in `config.json` and start the server once.

It does 2 things in all existing profiles: 
1. Ensure the main stash is selected
2. Unlock all traders listed in the config (Please note Jaeger will be unlocked even if the regarding quest is not completed)

## The Default configuration
By default, you are on `FactoryZB-1011` offraid position.

This means you can spawn on Customs or Factory.

The hideout and the main stash are only accessible on the `FactoryZB-1011`, `FactoryZB-1012` and `FactoryZB-1013`.

When player die, the position is reset to the `FactoryZB-1011` position.

Everything is configurable.


## More tweaks
Check the [Path To Tarkov Additions](https://github.com/guillaumearm/PathToTarkovAdditions) mod to setup additional restrictions.

## Modding API
Example: 
```js
if (!globalThis.PathToTarkovAPI) {
    Logger.error(`=> ${this.modName}: PathToTarkovAPI not found, are you sure a version of PathToTarkov >= 2.5.0 is installed ?`);
    return;
}

PathToTarkovAPI.onStart((sessionId) => {
    const config = PathToTarkovAPI.getConfig();
    const spawnConfig = PathToTarkovAPI.getSpawnConfig();

    // make some config changes
    config.player_scav_move_offraid_position = false;

    PathToTarkovAPI.setConfig(config);
    PathToTarkovAPI.setSpawnConfig(spawnConfig); // not needed if not changed, it's just for the example

    // should be called after setting new configs
    PathToTarkovAPI.refresh(sessionId);
})
```
